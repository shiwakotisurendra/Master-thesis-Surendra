<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p align="justify">Determination of spatial extent of the earth’s features, spectral coverage, and temporal analysis of geographic features has been used to delineate the ecological degradation and distortions in the earth’s landscape with high precision using the advanced image processing sensor of satellites. Rapid population growth, urban growth, deforestation, and deterioration of the natural resources has been occurring at a very high rate causing unnatural climate changes like drought and rapid increase in the surface temperature of the earth’s surface and hence producing highly heated zones called Urban Heat Island. Urban Heat Island deteriorates the ecological process, biological habitats, soil composition, climate structure, environmental cycles, and resident health. The focus of this study project is to perform spatiotemporal analysis of the land cover categories, statistical analysis of densely accumulated Land Surface Temperature (LST), determination of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, and comparative analysis of Land Cover Categories (LCC) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects occurring across the various regions of Bharatpur metropolitan city. Landsat 8 images were acquired from the USGS portal and then preprocessed using the GIS tool. A supervised classification algorithm was performed to derive land cover classes, while a single window algorithm and LST thresholding was used to generate different urban heat island zones. Correlation between remote sensing indices and land surface temperature was estimated to check the driving factors for Urban Heat Island. Effect in different time. It was verified by determining the land surface temperature distribution for different land cover categories. The results show that Builtup and uncultivated areas were increasing rapidly in the compensation of forest and agriculture areas. High moisture coverage in water bodies, forests, and agriculture contributed to nonUHI. Low UHI was found in sparsely distributed Builtup and uncultivated areas, while clustered Builtup and uncultivated areas were in dense UHI zones. This project will serve as a reference for spatiotemporal and statistical analysis for detecting land cover trends, Urban Heat Island occurrence and, surface temperature distribution across different land surface features.
